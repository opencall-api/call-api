# OpenCALL Demo Library — Design Status

**Project**: OpenCALL Demo Library
**CDS Round**: 5 (Gap Resolution — Complete)
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-14
**Source of truth**: `demo/docs/prompt.md`

## Overview

This CDS tracks the design health of the OpenCALL Demo Library. The demo is a multi-subdomain demonstration of the OpenCALL v1.0 specification:

- `api.opencall-api.com` — OpenCALL API server (11 operations)
- `demo.opencall-api.com` — Interactive dashboard with split-pane envelope viewer
- `www.opencall-api.com` — Static brochure site
- `agents.opencall-api.com` — AI agent instructions

## Current State (Round 5 — All Gaps Resolved)

**Tests**: 88 API + 36 App = 124 passing, 0 failing
**Gap report**: `demo/docs/gap-report.md` — 14 gaps identified, **14/14 resolved**

## Round History

### Round 1: Initial Analysis
- Identified 5 potential issues (4 resolved, 1 needs verification)
- Implementation ~95% complete

### Round 2: Design Alignment
- Synced prompt.md changes with CDS
- Found 2 conflicts: `items:checkin` scope, proxy wrapper authenticity

### Round 3: Conflict Resolution
- Implemented `items:checkin` scope (71 tests)
- Implemented direct API calls with CORS (36 tests)
- Both conflicts fully resolved

### Round 4: Post-Implementation Audit
- Audited all 4 services against prompt.md source of truth
- **14 gaps identified** (see `demo/docs/gap-report.md`)
- Critical finding: agents/index.md violates core spec principle
- Key theme: env var hardcoding across app and www services
- API core is solid (11/11 ops, all error codes, async lifecycle)
- Tests all passing (124 total) but some test assertions match wrong values

### Round 5: Gap Resolution (Current)
- **All 14 gaps resolved** across 4 parallel batches
- Batch 1: Rewrote agents/index.md to spec-compliant ~40 lines
- Batch 2: Fixed env var hardcoding across app (AGENTS_URL, API_URL, WWW_URL) and www (runtime templating)
- Batch 3: docker-compose now has all 4 services, GCS mock documented, API schemas aligned
- Batch 4: XKCD local asset, comparison table expanded, run-local.sh starts www
- All 18 concepts 🟢 Converged with 🟢 Complete design
- Tests: 88 API + 36 App = 124 passing, 0 failing
